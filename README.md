# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction - IBM Data Science Capstone

This project is part of the IBM Data Science Capstone.

**Objective**: The goal is to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land. Reusing the first stage can drastically reduce SpaceXâ€™s launch costs.

We aim to answer:
- Can we accurately predict Falcon 9's first stage landing success?
- What are the key factors influencing the landing outcome (e.g., payload mass, orbit type)?
- How can this prediction help competitors match or exceed SpaceX's success?

## Data Sources
- SpaceX API
- Web Scraping

## Methodology
1. Data Wrangling:
   - Filtering and cleaning the data
   - Handling missing values
   - Applying One Hot Encoding for categorical values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
   - SQL for data querying
   - Interactive visual analytics using `Folium` and `Plotly Dash`
3. Predictive Modeling:
   - Building, tuning, and evaluating classification models
   - Hyperparameter optimization

## Results
The analysis shows that [].

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into how certain factors, like payload mass and orbit type, influence the Falcon 9 landing success. These insights could potentially help other companies optimize their space missions and reduce costs by reusing rocket components.

## Repository Contents
- Data wrangling scripts
- EDA notebooks
- Machine learning models
